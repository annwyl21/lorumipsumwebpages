# lorumipsumwebpages
A collection of webpages that I am using to learn about Bootstrap.com tools and responsive functionality using lorumipsum text.

https://annwyl21.github.io/lorumipsumwebpages/index.html

The purpose of this work is two-fold:
1. to learn about responsive web design, using the inspect tool and js, css & html
1. to practise using git
    - to use meaningful messages to track my changes in git commits
    - to develop on a feature branch which is frequently merged into the main trunk to create a website that always works and rolls out features rather than being in a permanant state of 'under contruction'

### Notes to self:
- According to Bootstrap website, it has to be an HTML5 doctype to work properly

### Features Included:

###### From Bootstrap

**Info Alert:** an alert at the top of the index page, using the .alert and .alert-warning classes provided by Bootstrap. 

**Responsive Navigation Bar:** a navigation bar at the top of the page, currently including a non-functional search, demonstrating responsive design and using a working hamburger menu

###### From general websites/ you tube videos

**Title of the Tab:** when the user navigates away from the page it is an event called 'onpagehide', this document object event is listening to the window object, to trigger the js script to be run that changes the title of the page, in the page tab

###### From W3 Schools

**Favicon:** my webpage kept getting a 400 error for the favicon, so I googled what that was and spoke to the fountain of knowledge that is my 13 year old son and found a favicon generator on the w3 schools website, created my own and hey presto, my favicon 200 error is now a 200 ok
