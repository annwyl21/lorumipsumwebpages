# lorumipsumwebpages
A collection of webpages that I am using to learn about Bootstrap.com tools and responsive functionality using lorumipsum text.

https://annwyl21.github.io/lorumipsumwebpages/index.html

The purpose of this work is two-fold:
<ol>
<li>to learn about responsive web design, using the inspect tool and js, css & html</li>
<li>to practise using git
    <ul>
        <li>to use meaningful messages to track my changes in git commits</li>
        <li>to develop on a feature branch which is frequently merged into the main trunk to create a website that always works and rolls out features rather than being in a permanant state of 'under contruction'</li>
    </ul>
</li>
